 React Custom Hooks (Advanced)
    https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-custom-hook/

    Hooks gave function components the ability to use state and side-effects 
 with built-in Hooks such as React's useState Hook and React's useEffect Hook.

   There are only a handful built-in Hooks (e.g. useReducer, useCallback, 
 useMemo, useContext) provided by React though. However, by using these
 Hooks as a foundation, React developers can create their own hooks 
 called custom hooks.

 We will use the two hooks that we already know to create 
 a new custom hook called useStorageState which will keep 
 the component's state in sync with the browser's local 
 storage.  
  
   What is useState?
      - When a state gets mutated, the component with the state 
      and all child components will re-render.

   What is useEffect?
    - What does useEffect do? by using this hook you tell React that 
     your component needs to do something after render.

=============================================*/

import * as React from 'react';
 
  //Create a custom hook called "useStorageState". We will use two hooks 
  //to create it:
  //    1. useState
  //    2. useEffect 
  //So far this custom hook is just function around useState and useEffect.
  //What's missing is providing an initial state and returning the values
  //that are needed by the App component as an array.
  
  //This hook will keep the component's state in sync with the browser's 
  //local storage.  
  //using the the parameter key. it goes to the local storage
     //to  fetch the state if not found uses initialState and 
     //assigns it to "value" otherwise the state fetched from
     //local storage will be used and assigned to 'value
     //   Note: 1. value is the generic name for state
     //         2. setValue is the name of the function that will 
     //            update the 'value'
     //This code here: 
     //   React.useState(
     //    localStorage.getItem('key') || initialState
     //is simply a logic to determine what state to use.
  const useStorageState = (key, initialState) => {
     const [value, setValue] = React.useState(
        localStorage.getItem('key') || initialState //<-- this simply provides 
                             //an initial value to the hook. It will be the value 
                             //in localstorage or value of the parameter 
                             //'initialState'.
        //Note: to make it generic an resusable change 'search' to 'value'
        // localStorage.getItem('search') || initialState  
        //and change "setSearhTerm" to 'setValue' and 'searchTerm' to 'value'

     );

     //What does useEffect do? by using this hook you tell React that 
     //your component needs to do something after a render.
     //useEffect is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level 
     //of your component or your own Hooks. You canâ€™t call it inside 
     //loops or conditions. 
     //https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#useeffect
     React.useEffect(() => {
        //look for an item in the localStorage with the key of 'search/value' 
        //and set its value to 'searchTerm/value' state
        //Study: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/setItem
         localStorage.setItem(key, value);
        },
        [value, key] // [value]); //<-- React.useEffect is triggered when 
                //when this dependency variable changes. In our
                //case when a user types into the HTML input field)
        ); //EOF useEffect

        //Again to make it reusable, change 
        //localStorage.setItem('search', searchTerm), [searchTerm]; to'value'
        

     //And second, the returned values are returned as an array.
     //change [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] -->[value, value]
     return [value, setValue]; 

  } //EOF create custom hook
  
  
 // Eliminate "return" statement and enclosing bracket if no business 
 //business logic. Otherwise retain the {} and put a "return" statement

//========================================================== 
//Note on Map:
 //Within the map() method, we have access to each object and its properties.
 
 //useState
 //By using useState, we are telling React that we want to have a 
 //stateful value which changes over time. And whenever this stateful value 
 //changes, the affected components (here: Search component) 
 //will re-render to use it (here: to display the recent value).
